name: Masked Code Completion

description: >
  You will be provided with code containing masked values represented as MASK_X, where X is a number.
  Your task is to predict the exact replacement text for each masked value.
  Respond with a JSON block within triple backticks (```json) containing a dictionary where the keys are the masked value identifiers (e.g., 'MASK_0', 'MASK_1') and the values are your predicted replacement texts.
  If the JSON block is not formatted or closed properly or the JSON is not valid, you will FAIL the task.
  Ensure your response contains only the JSON block and no additional text or explanation.
